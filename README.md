In our day to day development activities, we might not get time to explore Sitecore Events. But it is always good to understand how Sitecore Events work internally which can help us troubleshoot issues and make our way easy to create custom events/remote events. In this session we will be looking at what is events, Design pattern which Sitecore uses for this feature, Creating simple event, Creating remote events, Dos and Don'ts for remote events etc.
